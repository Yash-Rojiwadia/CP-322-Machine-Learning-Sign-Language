This project's objective is to be able to recognize handwritten characters through optical character recognition. 
The ability to convert real-world text and handwriting into digital text has wide-ranging applications. 
However, this is a challenging problem because text can appear in many different fonts, sizes, and colors, and can be distorted or obscured in various ways. 
By using machine learning algorithms and image pre-processing techniques, OCR systems can improve their accuracy and performance in recognizing and 
classifying text in images.
we used the MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology" dataset), a widely-used dataset for training and testing machine learning 
algorithms designed to recognize handwritten digits. 
The dataset consists of a collection of images of handwritten digits, along with the corresponding labels that indicate the correct digit represented in each image.

Results :
The prediction accuracy while training the model for 6679 epochs was 94.26%.
